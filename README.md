# Carbon-Dioxide-Pollution-Monitoring-and-Alert-System
 Developed a prototype Carbon Dioxide Pollution Monitoring and Alert System
– It accurately detects and monitors carbon dioxide levels in indoor air to address health concerns associated with high CO2 concentrations.
– It provided hands-on experience on Arduino Uno, MQ 135 sensor, LED, buzzer, LM016Ldisplay, and Proteus simulation
